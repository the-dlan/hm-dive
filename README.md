# hm-dive
Basic Encryption/Decryption Python Script

Encrypts a text file into binary using a generated key from the Fernet library.
Overwrites existing file for both encryption and decryption.

Current implementation requires that you `cd` into the project directory to run the script.

Use `python hm-dive.py -h` for help.
